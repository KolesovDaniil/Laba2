# Spreadsheet
C++ laboratory work 
It was a part of our C++ programming course. I must code my version of "Excel" with three types of cell: functional, text, numeric.

The application architecture contains tha main absctract class and three inherited classes. This scheme allows to store the parent's
pointers into vector and by the needs cast them into specialized types. The Table class ia a container with special methods. 

UI was developed using Qt framework.
